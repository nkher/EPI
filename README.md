What is repository about ?
---------------------------
This repository contains the solutions to the book Elements of Programming interviews (EPI). Currently work is in progress. Currently am working on Go and Java solutions for the book. 


 Why this repository ? 
---------------------------
I really liked the book when I had read for the first time and hence wanted to put up my own solutions online. The repository is meant for anyone who are interested in algorithms overall or need have started to read the book and want simple, readable implementations to them. The code is easy to understand. For any suggestions, please reach me at the email provided at the bottom.
