Why this repository ? 
---------------------------
I really liked the book when I had read for the first time and hence wanted to put up my own solutions online. The repository is meant for anyone who is interested in algorithms/data structures. If you have started to read the book (or already read it) and want simple, readable implementations to them in golang, then please go through them. I am putting in an effort to make the code readable and easy to understand. Suggestions and improvements are welcome. For any suggestions, please reach me at the email provided at the bottom.
